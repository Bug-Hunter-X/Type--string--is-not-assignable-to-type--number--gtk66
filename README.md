This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The function `combine` is intended to concatenate two arrays of numbers. However, if either `arr1` or `arr2` contains a string, the `concat` method will produce an array that may contain strings.  TypeScript's type system flags this as an error because the function's return type is explicitly `number[]`, and the result might not match that type. The solution demonstrates how to handle this using type guards or more robust array handling.
